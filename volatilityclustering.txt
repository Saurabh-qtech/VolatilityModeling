In this project, I source stock data from yahoo finance using yfinance library.

The idea is to cluster stocks that have similar rolling volatility pattern across a T year time horizon with a window size B business days and plot graph to aid in visulaizing clusters.
PCA is used to reduce dimensionality.
Doing so reveals group of stocks that behave similarly in terms of risk (volatility)

Future Work -
    i. Vary window length to capture long term / short term shocks
    ii. Cluster on returns + vol or additional features like skew, kurtosis, beta, etc.
    iii. Use better clustering algo - DBSCAN, heirarichal clustering, GMM
    iv. Dynamic Clustering Over Time - 
    v. Evaluate cluster quality - metrics like silhouette score, inertia, or Daviesâ€“Bouldin index
    vi. Add Market Regime Overlays - Map clusters across bull vs. bear markets, high vs. low VIX regimes
    vii. Connect to Trade ideas
    viii. Incorporate Sector Information - Compare clusters against GICS sectors to see whether volatility clustering aligns or cuts across sectors


Limitations -
    i. This is only partial insight - as we cluster volatility and not returns
    ii. KMeans assumes spherical clusters, real world may non-spherical, 
    iii. Doesn't consider any macro factors, sector exposures
